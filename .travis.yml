# Let travis know the language it needs to run
language: python

# setup mysql service
#services:
#  - mysql

# Mention the python version in which travis will run the app
python:
  - "3.4"
  - "3.5"
  - "3.5-dev"  # 3.5 development branch

# command to install dependencies in the requirements file
# You can also install the coverage here to avoid it being in the requirements file
# It is important to avoid things like coverage, pep8 that are not required to run the app
install:
  - pip install -r requirements.txt

before_script:
  - mkdir logs


  # command to run tests
  # This is the script that enables travis to run the tests
  # There are many ways to do depending on how you want travis to run and get you coverage
  #script: true
  #  - nosetests --with-coverage --coverage report

  # Another command/method to run tests
script:
  - pytest

# This returns the coverage and let's coveralls know the coverage percent.
# Note that travis will build your system and get the coverage.
# It cannot display, therefore coveralls becomes important to get the coverage
# You can also use after_success
#after_script:
#  - coveralls

# Using codecov to get coverage
#after_success:
#  - codecov
